# SQL Project: Analyzing Olympic Data

## Description
This repository contains SQL queries for analyzing Olympic data, focusing on historical medal counts, participation statistics, and more. The project was completed as part of a Data Analysis Project Tutorial - Practice Writing SQL Queries using Real Dataset (Practice Complex SQL Queries) by TechTFQ.

## Installation
To run the queries, follow these steps:

Database Setup: Install [SQL Server/MySQL/PostgreSQL] and create a database.
Data Import: Execute the SQL scripts provided in the queries/ folder to populate your database with Olympic data.

## Usage
